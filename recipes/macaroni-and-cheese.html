    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Macaroni and cheese is a dish combining pasta (usually macaroni) with cheese or a cheese-based sauce. It can be made by tossing cooked pasta in a cheesy white sauce or made as a baked casserole.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>7 ounces elbow macaroni</li>
        <li>¼ cup butter</li>
        <li>3 tablespoons all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>2 cups milk</li>
        <li>1 (8 ounce) package cream cheese</li>
        <li>4 slices canned jalapeno peppers, chopped</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons Dijon mustard</li>
        <li>½ teaspoon ground black pepper</li>
        <li>salt to taste</li>
        <li>3 dashes hot sauce, or to taste</li>
        <li>2 cups shredded Cheddar cheese</li>
        <li>1 cup dry bread crumbs</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons butter</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons chopped fresh parsley</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C).</li>
        <li>Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook elbow macaroni in the boiling water, stirring occasionally until cooked through but firm to the bite, 8 to 10 minutes. Drain.</li>
        <li>Melt 1/4 cup butter in a 3-quart saucepan over medium heat. Stir flour into melted butter and cook until smooth and bubbling, about 1 minute. Mix milk, cream cheese, jalapeno peppers, Dijon mustard, black pepper, and salt into flour-butter mixture; cook, stirring occasionally, until sauce is thickened, about 5 minutes. Mix macaroni and Cheddar cheese into sauce; pour into a 2-quart casserole dish.</li>
        <li>Mix bread crumbs, 2 tablespoons butter, and parsley together in a bowl; spread over macaroni and cheese.</li>
        <li>Bake in the preheated oven until golden brown, 15 to 20 minutes.</li>
    </ol>
